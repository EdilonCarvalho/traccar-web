It would be interesting to leave the vehicle popup vertically positioned in the footer equal to the link image and reposition the attributes, this would allow 
adding a greater amount of attributes in addition to getting a more harmonious look https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/imagens/wl0ZaEo 
because in the original position, for those who prefer to add more attributes will cause the popup to greatly increase the height obstructing the view of 
vehicles on the map
